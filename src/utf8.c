/* Function: seq_nbytes()

   Returns the number of bytes determined using the first byte of a
   UTF-8 sequence. If the sequence is not a vaild initial byte of a
   UTF-8 sequence, 0 is returned.

   The length of any UTF-8 can be determined from the five most
   significant bits of the first byte. As shown in the table below,
   where x's represent unicode codepoint data.

   Firstly, bits are shifted right by 3 to retain only the five
   pertinent bits. This leaves 32 possible permiatations, which have
   been precalculated and stored in a look up table (lut).

   If the 5 bits do not match any of the four permissable values, the
   value returned is 0. 

   length byte[0]  byte[1]  byte[2]  byte[3]
   1      0xxxxxxx
   2      110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
   3      1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx

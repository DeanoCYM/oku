/* Electronic paper display bitmap buffer control. The buffer is
   designed to correspond to the portable bitmap format (PBM):

   Each row contains the same number of bits, packed 8 to a byte,
   don't care bits to fill out the last byte in the row if the width
   is not a factor of 8.

   Each bit represents a pixel: 1 is black, 0 is white.

   The order of the pixels is left to right. The order of their
   storage within each file byte is most significant bit to least
   significant bit. The order of the file bytes is from the beginning
   of the file toward the end of the file.

/* Function: utf8_next()

   Determines the next codepoint in a UTF-8 file and stores the value
   in out.

   On successful decode of UTF-8 sequence into a unicode codepoint,
   codepoint is stored in out and 0 is returned.

   If invalid character is detected -1 is returned and an appropriate
   placeholder character is stored in codepoint.

   If the file cannot be read, 1 is returned and codepoint is set the
   the placeholder character. */
